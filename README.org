#+TITLE: Fonts


#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A collection of fonts (with attribution if possible) that are a bit hard to find on the web.

* Font list
- Fira Code Symbol (from [[https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/issues/211#issuecomment-239058632][tonsky/FiraCode/issues/211]] by [[https://github.com/siegebell][@siegebell]])

  This is needed to get ligatures in Emacs working (for example, via
  =prettify-symbols= package)

* Licensing
I'll try to attribute fonts to their origins where possible.

Though, I'd like to make a disclaimer that *no* fonts in this repository are
either commercial/proprietary or made by me (in the latter case they would have
a separate repository).

The implication is: *no* contributions will be accepted (at least for now).
Bear with me.
